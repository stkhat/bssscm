# Bayesian State-Space SCM for Deforestation Baseline Estimation for Forest Carbon Credit

## Overview
This repository provides the code and resources necessary to replicate the results from the following paper:

Takahata, K., Suetsugu, H., Fukaya, K., Shirota, S. (2024): "Bayesian State-Space SCM for Deforestation Baseline Estimation for Forest Carbon Credit," to be published in *Environmental Data Science*.

## List of Scripts

- `run_scm.r`: Executes the estimation using the SCM (Synthetic Control Method).
- `run_causalimpact`: Executes the estimation using the CausalImpact.
- `run_bssscm.py`: Executes the estimation using our proposed method and compares the results with other methods.
